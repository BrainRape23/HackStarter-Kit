## üìú Important Disclaimer

This repository is strictly for **educational purposes only**. It contains tools, files, and resources that could potentially be misused in unethical or illegal activities.

üí° **It is the sole responsibility of the user** to ensure all actions and usage comply with applicable laws and regulations. Neither the authors nor contributors of this project condone, promote, or support illegal or unethical behavior. This pack is meant to help you understand vulnerabilities and protect systems, not exploit them.

## üß∞ What is this Repository?

The **HackerPack** is a collection of hacking tools, files, and personal resources aimed at helping enthusiasts and professionals deepen their knowledge about cybersecurity, exploits, and digital systems. Whether you're exploring vulnerabilities, learning how tools work, or analyzing device behavior, this pack provides a solid starting point.

### üîç What's Inside?

1. **Infrared (IR)**  
   A collection of IR signal files designed for testing and experimenting with devices like remotes or other devices with IR. These files are useful for analyzing and recreating IR signals.

2. **Sub-GHz Protocols**  
   Files and configurations for exploring Sub-GHz communication, including potential use cases for bypassing locks, interacting with older wireless systems, or analyzing obscure frequencies.

3. **Bad USB & BLE**  
   Some scripts to test on your phone or PC. These scripts showcase how USB devices and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) interactions can be manipulated, allowing you to explore vulnerabilities or test payloads. Always use these in controlled environments and with proper permissions.

4. **Evil Portals**  
   Prebuilt templates and configurations for custom captive portals. These can be used to understand phishing tactics or test network redirection in controlled environments.

5. **MyProducts**  
   A unique section showcasing how my personal devices work, including configurations and links to where I purchased them. This serves as a practical reference for real-world hacking scenarios.

### üéØ Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to offer a playground for exploring hacking techniques and understanding how different exploits function. By working with these files and tools, users can gain insights into how to secure their systems and think like an attacker to build better defenses.
