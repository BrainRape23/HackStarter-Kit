### **Important Note**  
Some of the tools and devices mentioned in this repository can be used in ways that interfere with wireless signals or other devices. Please be aware that such activities may be **illegal** in many countries unless performed in controlled, authorized, or experimental environments. Always ensure you have explicit permission before conducting any experiments, and avoid disrupting public or private networks.

This folder contains a collection of information and links about products that I own and use.

## M5StickC PLUS2
The **M5StickC PLUS2** was my first-ever device that I used for experimenting with some "hacking" projects. It was incredibly fun to explore and experiment with, and it provided a fantastic opportunity to learn a lot about hardware and programming.

I personally used the **Bruce firmware** on this device because I believe it’s the best firmware for the M5StickC series. It offers excellent features and flexibility for projects like this. If you want to know what you can do with it, take a look at the official GitHub site of Bruce: [Bruce Firmware on GitHub](https://github.com/pr3y/Bruce)

## NRF24 Module
The **NRF24 Module** is, or still remains, one of the most fascinating modules I’ve worked with. The reason? It can be used to interfere with the entire 2.4 GHz signal range. This includes signals like Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz), BLE, and Zigbee, which all operate within this frequency band.

What happens if you jam the 2.4 GHz signal?  
- **Wi-Fi**: It becomes extremely slow or stops working entirely.  
- **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)**: Devices fail to connect or communicate.  
- **Zigbee**: Zigbee-based devices also stop functioning properly.  

As you can imagine, this makes experimenting with it quite fun (though potentially disruptive). For example, using it in buses or trains can really annoy people!

## CC1101 Module
The **CC1101 Module** is a highly versatile RF transceiver designed for low-power wireless applications. It operates on a wide range of frequencies, making it an excellent choice for custom wireless communication projects. This module is widely used for IoT devices, remote control systems, and even for exploring wireless communication protocols.

### Features:
- **Frequency Range:** Supports multiple ISM bands, including 315 MHz, 433 MHz, 868 MHz, and 915 MHz.
- **Low Power Consumption:** Ideal for battery-operated devices.
- **Customizable Protocols:** Allows users to work with and even reverse-engineer protocols for experimentation.

### My Experience:
The **CC1101 Module** is one of the most exciting modules for learning about custom wireless communication. It's a fantastic tool for exploring RF protocols, especially for devices like garage door openers, remote controls, and weather stations. With the proper setup, it can even be used to intercept or replay RF signals, making it both educational and practical. You can even open Tesla charging doors, but unlocking the cars themselves is much more challenging.

## M5Stack IR Remote
The **M5Stack IR Remote** was my first infrared (IR) module for the M5Stick. It’s incredibly useful because it allows you to copy IR signals and save them on your device for later use.

Although the range is limited to about 5 meters (depending on the environment), it’s still a great tool for controlling various IR-enabled devices like TVs, air conditioners, and more. This module is perfect for learning about IR communication and creating custom remote control solutions.

## TF Micro SD Card Module

The **TF Micro SD Card Module** is a simple and cost-effective way to add microSD storage to devices like the M5Stick. It supports SPI communication and is ideal for applications like data logging and file storage.

This version comes with pin headers (not soldered), allowing for flexible configurations. It's a great choice for both beginners and advanced users.

## CH9329 USB Module

The **CH9329 USB Module** allows USB keyboard or mouse emulation, making it ideal for creating **BadUSB scripts**.

### Features:
- Emulates USB keyboard/mouse.
- Compact and affordable.
- Supports custom scripts.

## Infrared Transmitter Module (PCP0100)

The **Infrared Transmitter Module** is a simple and affordable IR module designed for Arduino projects. It offers a **better range** compared to the M5 IR Remote, making it ideal for long-distance applications like remote controls or communication.

### Features:
- **Improved Range**: Provides stronger signal transmission over greater distances.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple 3-pin interface (GND, VCC, DATA) for seamless use with microcontrollers.
- **Limitations**: Unlike the M5 IR Remote, this module **cannot copy or store signals**, making it suitable only for transmitting pre-programmed signals.

## Dupont Jumper Wires

These **Dupont Jumper Wires** are incredibly affordable and versatile for any DIY electronics project. Available in various configurations (male-to-male, male-to-female, female-to-female), they are perfect for prototyping and connecting components.

For the price, there's nothing to complain about – they get the job done!
