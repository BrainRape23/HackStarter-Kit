## NRF24 Module
The **NRF24 Module** is, or still remains, one of the most fascinating modules I’ve worked with. The reason? It can be used to interfere with the entire 2.4 GHz signal range. This includes signals like Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz), BLE, and Zigbee, which all operate within this frequency band.

What happens if you jam the 2.4 GHz signal?  
- **Wi-Fi**: It becomes extremely slow or stops working entirely.  
- **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)**: Devices fail to connect or communicate.  
- **Zigbee**: Zigbee-based devices also stop functioning properly.  

As you can imagine, this makes experimenting with it quite fun (though potentially disruptive). For example, using it in buses or trains can really annoy people!
